    <p class="history-text">
      Stegosaurus was a large, plant-eating dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, around 155 to 150 million years ago. Its name means “roofed lizard,” a reference to the large, flat plates along its back that early scientists once believed lay flat like shingles. The first fossil was discovered in Colorado in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh, and since then, more fossils have been found in North America and parts of Europe.
      <br><br>
      This dinosaur measured around 26 to 30 feet long and stood about 9 feet tall. It had a small head, a bulky body, and walked on all fours. One of its most distinctive features was the double row of large, kite-shaped plates running along its spine. The exact purpose of these plates is still debated—some believe they were used for display or species recognition, while others suggest they helped regulate body temperature.
      <br><br>
      Stegosaurus also had a powerful tail equipped with four long, sharp spikes known as the “thagomizer.” This tail was likely used as a defensive weapon against predators. Fossil evidence shows injuries on other dinosaurs that may have come from these tail spikes, supporting the idea that Stegosaurus used them effectively to defend itself.
      <br><br>
      Despite its large body, Stegosaurus had a remarkably small brain—about the size of a walnut. This has led to the outdated belief that it was unintelligent, but brain size alone doesn’t always indicate behavior. It relied more on its physical features for survival, using its size, tail, and plates to protect itself from carnivorous dinosaurs like Allosaurus.
      <br><br>
      Stegosaurus lived in a lush, semi-arid environment filled with ferns, cycads, and conifer trees. As a herbivore, it used its beak-like mouth to strip vegetation and its flat teeth to grind plant material. It likely moved slowly and spent much of its time feeding on low-growing plants.
      <br><br>
      Although it went extinct long before the famous Tyrannosaurus rex appeared, Stegosaurus remains one of the most iconic dinosaurs. Its unique appearance makes it a favorite among dinosaur enthusiasts and paleontologists. Ongoing research continues to shed light on how this armored dinosaur lived, interacted, and evolved in the Jurassic world.

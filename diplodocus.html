    <p class="history-text">
  Diplodocus was one of the longest dinosaurs to ever walk the Earth, living during the Late Jurassic period around 154 to 150 million years ago. Its name means “double beam,” referring to the unique structure of bones beneath its tail. Fossils of Diplodocus have been found mainly in North America, particularly in the western United States, such as Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana.
  <br><br>
  Diplodocus could reach lengths of up to 90 feet, with some estimates suggesting even longer individuals. Despite its size, it was relatively lightweight for a sauropod, weighing around 12 to 16 tons. Its long neck and tail gave it an elegant, whip-like appearance, and it likely used its tail for defense or communication.
  <br><br>
  As a herbivore, Diplodocus fed on low-lying plants and possibly ferns and horsetails. Its peg-like teeth were located only at the front of its mouth, allowing it to strip leaves from branches efficiently. It likely swallowed plant material whole, relying on its massive gut to digest tough vegetation.
  <br><br>
  Its long neck allowed it to reach wide areas of foliage without moving its massive body much. Some scientists believe Diplodocus held its neck horizontally, sweeping it across the ground or through trees to feed. This feeding strategy may have helped it avoid direct competition with other high-browsing sauropods.
  <br><br>
  Diplodocus had a relatively small head compared to its body and a simple brain structure, but its size alone would have discouraged most predators. Its long tail may have also served as a deterrent, possibly used like a whip to scare off threats or signal to others in its group.
  <br><br>
  Diplodocus became one of the first sauropods to be widely recognized by the public thanks to its early discovery in the late 19th century. It remains a favorite among dinosaur fans and continues to be studied by paleontologists for clues about sauropod behavior, biology, and evolution.

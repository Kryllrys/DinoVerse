    <p class="history-text">
      The Tyrannosaurus rex, commonly known as T. rex, is arguably the most famous and iconic dinosaur that ever lived. Its name, which means "Tyrant Lizard King," perfectly reflects its position as one of the top predators of the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 68 to 66 million years ago. With fossil evidence primarily found in North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, T. rex is believed to have ruled the prehistoric landscape as a dominant carnivore.
      <br><br>
      Measuring up to 40 feet (12 meters) in length and standing about 12 feet (3.7 meters) tall at the hips, the T. rex could weigh between 9 to 14 tons. Its most distinctive features include a massive skull filled with sharp, banana-sized teeth capable of delivering one of the most powerful bites in the animal kingdom. Its bite force is estimated to be over 12,000 pounds, strong enough to crush bones with ease.
      <br><br>
      Despite its small forearms—which were only about three feet long—T. rex was far from weak. These tiny arms were heavily muscled and may have been used to hold prey in place. Its legs, however, were long and powerful, enabling it to move quickly across its territory, possibly reaching speeds of 12 to 20 miles per hour. Its long, heavy tail helped it balance its enormous head and body while moving or hunting.
      <br><br>
      Paleontologists believe that T. rex was both a scavenger and an active predator. It likely hunted large herbivorous dinosaurs like Triceratops and Edmontosaurus but may also have fed on carrion when the opportunity arose. Its keen senses—especially smell and vision—made it a formidable hunter.
      <br><br>
      The discovery of over 50 fossil specimens, including nearly complete skeletons, has provided valuable insights into T. rex’s life. Notably, the fossil named “Sue,” discovered in South Dakota in 1990, remains one of the most complete and well-preserved T. rex skeletons ever found.
      <br><br>
      Tyrannosaurus rex went extinct around 66 million years ago during the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, likely caused by a massive asteroid impact that dramatically changed Earth’s climate. Yet, despite its extinction, T. rex lives on in popular culture, movies, books, and museum exhibits, continuing to fascinate people of all ages and reminding us of Earth’s prehistoric past.

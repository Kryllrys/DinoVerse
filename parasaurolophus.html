    <p class="history-text">
  Parasaurolophus was a herbivorous dinosaur known for its long, curved crest on top of its head. It lived during the Late Cretaceous period around 76 to 73 million years ago and belonged to a group called hadrosaurids, or “duck-billed” dinosaurs. Fossils have been found in North America, particularly in Canada and the western United States.
  <br><br>
  Parasaurolophus grew up to 33 feet long and weighed around 2.5 tons. Its body was built for both bipedal and quadrupedal movement, allowing it to walk on two legs or all fours depending on the activity. Its tail was long and stiff, likely helping with balance while running or walking.
  <br><br>
  The most distinctive feature of Parasaurolophus was its crest, which could reach over five feet in length. This hollow structure connected to the nose and may have been used to produce sounds, helping with communication among members of its species. The crest may also have served in visual display or to help regulate body temperature.
  <br><br>
  As a plant-eater, Parasaurolophus had hundreds of tightly packed teeth forming a grinding surface for chewing tough vegetation. It likely fed on leaves, pine needles, and twigs. Its strong jaws and chewing ability allowed it to process food more efficiently than many earlier dinosaurs.
  <br><br>
  Fossil evidence suggests that Parasaurolophus lived in herds and may have migrated in search of food and better climates. Its social behavior, combined with its advanced vocalization abilities, indicates a complex and interactive lifestyle among herd members.
  <br><br>
  Parasaurolophus remains one of the most recognizable hadrosaurs due to its unique crest. It continues to be a favorite among scientists and dinosaur enthusiasts, often featured in museum displays and films for its unusual appearance and potential for ancient dinosaur "calls."

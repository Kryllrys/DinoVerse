    <p class="history-text">
  Therizinosaurus was one of the most unusual-looking dinosaurs, known for its massive claws and strange body structure. It lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 70 million years ago, in what is now Mongolia. Its name means “scythe lizard,” referring to its incredibly long, curved claws that could reach over three feet in length.
  <br><br>
  Unlike most other theropods, which were carnivorous, Therizinosaurus was likely herbivorous. It had a small head with a beak and leaf-shaped teeth, suggesting it fed on plants. Its long neck allowed it to reach high vegetation, much like a modern-day giraffe. Its exact diet remains a subject of debate, but it likely included leaves, fruits, and soft vegetation.
  <br><br>
  Therizinosaurus could grow up to 33 feet long and weigh about 5 tons. It had a pot-bellied body, long arms with enormous claws, and stout hind limbs. Despite its odd appearance, it was well-adapted to its environment, using its claws possibly for defense, pulling branches, or even digging.
  <br><br>
  Its feathers, which were likely present based on related species, suggest it may have had some insulation or display features. While no direct evidence of feathers on Therizinosaurus itself has been found, its relatives in the Therizinosauridae family show clear signs of feathered bodies.
  <br><br>
  Therizinosaurus is believed to have been a slow-moving dinosaur due to its body structure and heavy build. It likely relied on its size and fearsome claws to deter predators rather than speed. Its unusual body plan puzzled scientists for decades before more complete fossil finds clarified its appearance.
  <br><br>
  Today, Therizinosaurus fascinates paleontologists and the public alike for its mix of traits—long claws, plant-eating habits, and possible feathers—making it one of the most bizarre and intriguing dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period.

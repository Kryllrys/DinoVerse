    <p class="history-text">
      Ankylosaurus was a heavily armored dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 68 to 66 million years ago. Its name means “fused lizard,” referring to the way its bones were tightly joined together, creating a nearly impenetrable body shield. The first fossils of Ankylosaurus were discovered in Montana in 1906 by Barnum Brown, and more remains have since been found in North America, especially in the western United States and Canada.
      <br><br>
      This dinosaur was about 25 to 30 feet long and weighed up to 8 tons. It walked on all fours with a wide, low-slung body and short, sturdy legs. Its most striking feature was the thick armor covering its back—made of bony plates called osteoderms—as well as spikes along its sides for extra protection against predators.
      <br><br>
      Ankylosaurus is best known for its large, bony club at the end of its tail. This tail club was made of fused bone and could be swung with great force, possibly strong enough to break the bones of attacking predators like Tyrannosaurus rex. It was a powerful defensive weapon and one of the key adaptations that helped Ankylosaurus survive in a dangerous environment.
      <br><br>
      As a herbivore, Ankylosaurus fed on low-lying plants such as ferns and shrubs. Its broad snout and small, leaf-shaped teeth suggest it was not a picky eater and likely grazed on a wide variety of vegetation. Its beak-like mouth helped it bite off plants, and it may have had a large gut to digest the tough plant material.
      <br><br>
      Although it looked slow and heavy, Ankylosaurus was well-adapted for survival. Its body armor and tail club made it one of the most well-protected dinosaurs of its time. It likely spent much of its life grazing and avoiding open confrontation, relying on its natural defenses only when threatened.
      <br><br>
      Today, Ankylosaurus continues to be a favorite among dinosaur enthusiasts due to its tank-like appearance and unique defense features. While complete skeletons are rare, fossil discoveries and modern reconstructions have given scientists a clearer picture of how this armored dinosaur lived and thrived in the final days of the dinosaur age.

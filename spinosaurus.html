    <p class="history-text">
      Spinosaurus was one of the largest and most unusual carnivorous dinosaurs, living around 100 to 93 million years ago during the mid-Cretaceous period. Its name means “spine lizard,” referring to the long, sail-like spines on its back that may have supported a skin-covered sail or hump. The first Spinosaurus fossils were discovered in Egypt in 1912, but many were destroyed during World War II. Fortunately, new finds in North Africa have helped scientists better understand this incredible creature.
      <br><br>
     Estimates suggest that Spinosaurus could reach lengths of 50 to 59 feet, making it even longer than Tyrannosaurus rex. It had a long, narrow skull with conical teeth, more like a crocodile’s than a typical theropod’s. This unique snout, along with its backward-facing teeth, suggests it was well-adapted for catching slippery prey like fish.
      <br><br>
      One of the most fascinating things about Spinosaurus is that it may have been semi-aquatic, spending much of its time in rivers and swamps. Fossil evidence, including its dense bones and paddle-like feet, supports this idea. It likely hunted in the water, using its strong arms and claws to snatch fish and other aquatic animals, making it one of the few known dinosaurs to live a mostly aquatic lifestyle.
      <br><br>
      The tall spines on Spinosaurus’s back were over five feet long and are thought to have supported a sail or hump. Scientists are still debating the purpose of this structure. It may have been used for display, to regulate body temperature, or to store fat like a camel’s hump. Whatever its purpose, it made Spinosaurus one of the most visually striking dinosaurs.
      <br><br>
      Despite its massive size, Spinosaurus was not built for speed on land. Its legs were relatively short, and its center of gravity suggests it was more comfortable in the water. It may have walked on all fours at times, unlike most other large theropods that stood upright on two legs.
      <br><br>
      Spinosaurus continues to capture the imagination of scientists and dinosaur fans alike. Ongoing discoveries in Morocco and other parts of North Africa are shedding new light on its anatomy and behavior. With its bizarre mix of aquatic and terrestrial traits, Spinosaurus stands out as one of the most unique predators in dinosaur history.

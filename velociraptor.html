    <p class="history-text">
      The Velociraptor was a small but fierce predator that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, about 75 to 71 million years ago. Its name means “swift thief,” a fitting title for a fast and agile hunter. The first Velociraptor fossil was discovered in Mongolia in 1923, and most known specimens have come from Central Asia, particularly the Gobi Desert.
      <br><br>
      Unlike its large and terrifying movie version in popular films, the real Velociraptor was much smaller, roughly the size of a turkey. It measured around 6 to 7 feet long, stood about 1.6 feet tall at the hip, and weighed only around 30 pounds. Despite its size, it was a dangerous predator with sharp teeth and powerful claws, especially the sickle-shaped claw on each hind foot used for slashing prey.
      <br><br>
      Velociraptors were likely covered in feathers, a fact supported by fossil discoveries showing quill knobs on their forearms. This suggests they shared a close evolutionary link to modern birds. Although they couldn’t fly, the feathers might have helped with balance, display, or temperature regulation. This bird-like trait changed how scientists view their behavior and classification.
      <br><br>
      They were carnivorous and probably hunted small animals, reptiles, and possibly even baby dinosaurs. Some scientists believe they may have hunted in packs, but others argue that the evidence isn’t strong enough to confirm that. A famous fossil known as the “Fighting Dinosaurs” shows a Velociraptor locked in combat with a Protoceratops, suggesting they were aggressive and active hunters.
      <br><br>
      Velociraptors were intelligent for their size, with relatively large brains compared to many other dinosaurs. Their sharp senses and agility would have made them excellent hunters. Their long, stiff tails helped with balance while running or turning quickly, and their arms, though small, were strong and likely used for grasping prey.
      <br><br>
      Even though Velociraptors went extinct during the same mass extinction event 66 million years ago that wiped out most other dinosaurs, they have lived on in popular culture. Their portrayal in movies has made them iconic, though not always scientifically accurate. Ongoing fossil discoveries continue to reveal more about their true nature, helping us better understand the real animals behind the legend.

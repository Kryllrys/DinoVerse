   <p class="history-text">
  Allosaurus was one of the most fearsome predators of the Late Jurassic period, living approximately 155 to 150 million years ago. Its name means “different lizard,” referring to unique features in its vertebrae. Fossils of Allosaurus have been primarily found in North America, especially in the Morrison Formation, which is rich in Jurassic dinosaur remains.
  <br><br>
  Measuring up to 35 feet in length and weighing around 2 to 4 tons, Allosaurus had a large skull filled with sharp, serrated teeth that were perfect for slicing through flesh. It had strong legs for running and powerful arms equipped with three large claws, which it likely used to grip and tear at prey.
  <br><br>
  Unlike some of the later giant predators, Allosaurus had a lighter, more agile build. This made it a fast and active hunter capable of taking down large herbivorous dinosaurs like Stegosaurus and Camarasaurus. It may have used ambush tactics or hunted in small groups to increase its success rate.
  <br><br>
  One of the most distinctive features of Allosaurus was the pair of bony ridges above its eyes, which may have been used for display, species recognition, or even protecting its eyes during combat. Its flexible neck and wide jaw gave it an impressive range of motion while attacking prey.
  <br><br>
  Paleontologists have discovered dozens of Allosaurus skeletons, including juveniles and adults, giving scientists a detailed understanding of its growth, behavior, and anatomy. Some fossil evidence even shows healed injuries, suggesting it led a violent life and may have engaged in fights with other dinosaurs.
  <br><br>
  Allosaurus remains one of the most iconic meat-eating dinosaurs and is often featured in museums and documentaries. Its role as an apex predator of the Jurassic period makes it an essential part of understanding prehistoric ecosystems and the evolution of large theropods.

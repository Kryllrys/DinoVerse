    <p class="history-text">
      The Triceratops is one of the most recognizable dinosaurs, known for its three horns and large frill. It lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 68 to 66 million years ago, and roamed what is now North America. The first fossils were discovered in the late 1800s, and the name Triceratops, meaning “three-horned face,” was given by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1889. Initially mistaken for a type of giant bison, the Triceratops was soon identified as a unique and important member of the dinosaur family.
      <br><br>
      This dinosaur was a herbivore, feeding mostly on low-lying plants like ferns and cycads. Its parrot-like beak and strong jaw muscles helped it clip and chew tough vegetation. Fossils suggest that it had rows of cheek teeth that formed a grinding surface, perfect for processing plant material. Because of its large size—about 30 feet long and weighing several tons—it likely needed to eat vast amounts of food each day to survive.
      <br><br>
      Triceratops had a massive skull, one of the largest of any land animal, which could be over 8 feet long. The skull included two long brow horns and a smaller nose horn, along with a bony frill that extended over its neck. Scientists debate the exact purpose of the frill and horns, but they may have been used for defense, mating displays, or social dominance within herds.
      <br><br>
      Evidence from fossilized bones suggests that Triceratops may have lived in groups, although some researchers believe they were more solitary. Battle scars on fossils indicate that they sometimes fought with each other, perhaps over mates or territory. Their biggest predator was likely the Tyrannosaurus rex, and some fossils show healed wounds that could have been caused by these fierce encounters.
      <br><br>
      The Triceratops was one of the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the mass extinction event 66 million years ago. This extinction, likely triggered by a large asteroid impact and subsequent environmental changes, wiped out about 75% of Earth's species, including all non-bird dinosaurs. Triceratops, like many others, did not survive the catastrophic shift.
      <br><br>
      Today, Triceratops remains a favorite among dinosaur enthusiasts and scientists alike. Its fossils are commonly found and studied, making it one of the best-known dinosaurs. It has become a symbol of prehistoric life and is often featured in films, books, and museum exhibits, capturing imaginations and helping us understand the ancient world in which it lived.

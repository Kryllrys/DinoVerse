    <p class="history-text">
  Iguanodon was one of the first dinosaurs ever discovered and named, dating back to the Early Cretaceous period around 140 to 110 million years ago. Its name means “iguana tooth,” because its fossilized teeth resembled those of modern iguanas. The first remains were discovered in England in the early 1800s, making it a key species in the early study of paleontology.
  <br><br>
  Iguanodon could grow up to 30 feet long and weigh around 3 to 5 tons. It had a bulky body, strong hind legs, and smaller forelimbs that could be used for walking or manipulating objects. One of its most famous features was its large, thumb spike, which may have been used for defense or breaking open tough plant material.
  <br><br>
  As a herbivore, Iguanodon primarily fed on ferns, cycads, and other prehistoric plants. It had strong, beak-like jaws for cropping vegetation and rows of grinding teeth for chewing tough plant matter. Its flexible hands may have helped it grasp and pull branches while feeding.
  <br><br>
  Iguanodon was likely a social animal, possibly traveling in herds for protection against predators. Its ability to walk on both two legs and four gave it versatility in movement and feeding. Juveniles may have walked on all fours more often, while adults likely used bipedal locomotion for faster movement.
  <br><br>
  Numerous Iguanodon fossils have been discovered across Europe and parts of Asia and North Africa, providing a rich understanding of its anatomy and behavior. The famous discovery of a mass Iguanodon grave in Belgium in the late 1800s revealed many well-preserved skeletons and supported the idea of herding behavior.
  <br><br>
  Iguanodon holds an important place in the history of paleontology as one of the first dinosaurs ever reconstructed. Early models were inaccurate, but later discoveries helped correct the image of this fascinating dinosaur. Today, Iguanodon is celebrated as a symbol of scientific discovery and evolution in paleontological research.

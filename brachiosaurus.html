    <p class="history-text">
      Brachiosaurus was one of the largest dinosaurs to ever walk the Earth, living during the Late Jurassic period about 154 to 150 million years ago. Its name means “arm lizard,” referring to its unusually long front legs, which were longer than its hind legs—a feature that gave it a distinctive, giraffe-like stance. The first Brachiosaurus fossil was discovered in Colorado in 1900 by Elmer Riggs, who recognized it as a new kind of sauropod dinosaur.
      <br><br>
      This massive dinosaur could reach lengths of up to 80 feet and weigh as much as 60 tons. Its long neck allowed it to reach vegetation high up in trees, something most other dinosaurs couldn’t do. Unlike many other sauropods, which held their necks horizontally, Brachiosaurus held its neck upright, allowing it to feed from the tallest conifers and other Jurassic trees.
      <br><br>
      Brachiosaurus was a herbivore, feeding on a diet of leaves, ferns, and possibly fruit. Its peg-like teeth were suited for stripping vegetation rather than chewing, so it likely swallowed its food whole. It may have had a large digestive system to help break down the tough plant material, allowing it to extract enough nutrients to sustain its massive body.
      <br><br>
      Despite its size, Brachiosaurus likely moved at a slow and steady pace. Its long, pillar-like legs and large feet helped support its weight and may have allowed it to walk through shallow water or open plains. Fossil trackways suggest that it may have lived in herds, moving together to find food and water sources.
      <br><br>
      Brachiosaurus lived in what is now North America, particularly in regions like Colorado and Utah, which were part of a warm, semi-arid environment filled with rivers and forests during the Jurassic period. Similar dinosaurs have also been found in Africa, but they belong to closely related genera like Giraffatitan, which was once considered a species of Brachiosaurus.
      <br><br>
      Although it went extinct millions of years ago, Brachiosaurus remains a popular dinosaur, often featured in museums, books, and movies. Its long neck and towering height make it one of the most iconic sauropods in history. Scientific discoveries continue to provide more insights into its biology, behavior, and role in the ancient ecosystems of the Jurassic world.
